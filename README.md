# NYC Citi Bike Analysis and Des Moines Bike Sharing Program

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to analize data from the NYC Citi Bike for the month of August of 2019 and use these data to help to build a bike program for the city of Des Moines.  NYC and Des Moines are popular cities in US, very active but Des Moines is a small town that is growing.  The bike program will fit Des Moines perfect because biking is now one of the attractions for development cities and the size of the city help to make this bike program more useful for people living in there.  

To analize the data for NYC we used Tableau and we made a story to show the results of the analysis.  The summary of the analysis is as follow:
- We made questions about the data that help us to understand how Citi Bike works in NYC, if the program is being used for people living in there, and how big is the system.
- To answer the questions, we made the visualizations in Tableau and analize what the data is telling us.
- We looked information about Des Moines and find out if a bike program is suitable for the city.

## Questions:
- What are the most popular routes, why?
- Gender preferences routes.
- Duration of each trip.
- Times the trips are busier.
- What type of places the busier routes go.
- Number of trips per day.
- Birthday per trip.
- Check where the routes start.
- If routes are link with transportation like subway, bus, etc.
- Check if the routes go to tourist places and if go to work places.
- Compare populations with NYC and Des Moines.
- Compare populations by gender if this can affect the number of trips.
- See if McDonalds locations has some impact on the bike routes.

## Des Moines Highlights
- *The idea to have a citybike in Des Moines is because over the past 15 years Des Moines has transformed into one of the richest, most vibrant, and hip cities in the country, where the local arts scene, entrepreneurial startups and established corporate employers are all thriving. Its downtown — previously desolate after 5 p.m. — has come alive, with 10,000 new residents and a bevy of nationally recognized restaurants. A few blocks away, the uber-cool Des Moines Social Club draws 25,000 people a month — more than a 10th of the city’s population — to take part in everything from Shakespeare and avant-garde theater to live music and aerial gymnastics classes.

In recent years Des Moines has been named the nation’s richest (by U.S. News) and economically strongest city (Policom), its best for young professionals (Forbes), families (Kiplinger), home renters (Time), businesses and careers (Forbes). It has the highest community pride in the nation, according to a Gallup poll in 2015, and in October topped a Bloomberg analysis of which cities in the United States were doing the best at attracting millennials to buy housing. “Never mind California or New York,” Fast Company declared two years back. “By some important measures, Des Moines is way ahead of its cooler coastal cousins.” Not bad for a metro area of half a million located hundreds of miles from either mountains or the sea.
